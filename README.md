# Soroban Project

## Project Structure

This repository uses the recommended structure for a Soroban project:

```text
.
├── contracts
│   └── hello_world
│       ├── src
│       │   ├── lib.rs
│       │   └── test.rs
│       └── Cargo.toml
├── Cargo.toml
├── AGENTS.md
└── README.md
```

- New Soroban contracts can be put in `contracts`, each in their own directory. There is already a `hello_world` contract in there to get you started.
- If you initialized this project with any other example contracts via `--with-example`, those contracts will be in the `contracts` directory as well.
- Contracts should have their own `Cargo.toml` files that rely on the top-level `Cargo.toml` workspace for their dependencies.
- Frontend libraries can be added to the top-level directory as well. If you initialized this project with a frontend template via `--frontend-template` you will have those files already included.

----
This is a Stellar smart-contract workspace (Soroban). Each contract is a workspace member under `contracts/<name>/`.

## Layout

- `Cargo.toml` — workspace root; contract crates inherit `soroban-sdk` from here
- `contracts/<name>/src/lib.rs` — contract implementation (`#![no_std]`)
- `contracts/<name>/src/test.rs` — host-side unit tests

## Build

From the workspace root:

```sh
stellar contract build
```

That compiles every `cdylib` member to WASM. Artifacts land in `target/wasm32v1-none/release/*.wasm`. Build one crate with `stellar contract build --package <name>`.

Do not substitute this with `cargo build --target wasm32v1-none`. `stellar contract build` applies the flags and metadata the network expects.

The `wasm32v1-none` Rust target must be installed (`rustup target add wasm32v1-none`). Rust 1.84 or newer is required for that target. Rust 1.82 and 1.83 cannot build contracts.

## Test

Host tests run with the normal Cargo test harness (not on-chain):

```sh
cargo test
```

A single crate: `cargo test -p <name>`.

## Deploy and invoke

On testnet, after a successful build:

```sh
stellar contract deploy \
  --wasm target/wasm32v1-none/release/<name>.wasm \
  --source-account <identity> \
  --network testnet \
  --alias <alias>

stellar contract invoke \
  --id <alias> \
  --network testnet \
  --source-account <identity> \
  -- hello --to world
```

The sample `hello_world` contract exposes `hello(to: String) -> Vec<String>`. Replace that with your own functions; `stellar contract invoke --id <id> -- -h` prints the generated CLI for the deployed contract.
